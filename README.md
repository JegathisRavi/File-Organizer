This script serves as a file organizer, designed to arrange files according to their extensions by relocating them into folders named after their respective extensions.

To execute it, run the command "python Organizer.py" in your command prompt or utilize your preferred IDE.

It operates exclusively within the local storage and does not support external storage devices.

For instance, a file named "sample.pdf" would be placed into a folder labeled "PDF".
